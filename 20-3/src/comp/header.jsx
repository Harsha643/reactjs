      <p>I am Harshavardhan Battu, a passionate and ambitious B.Tech (ECE) student from Kshatriya College of Engineering, graduating in June 2024. My journey in technology began with front-end development, where I mastered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Git, and Figma. Through hands-on projects like my Netflix clone, Netplay, I explored responsive design, animations, and advanced CSS concepts. My internship at Nikistian Media Private Limited further strengthened my skills and introduced me to real-world development challenges.

However, my interests have expanded beyond front-end development. I am deeply fascinated by Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), cloud observability, system administration, and DevOps. I want to explore Linux/Windows systems, database optimization, big data analysis, and network administration to build reliable and scalable systems.

I am also focusing on Python data structures and algorithms, sharpening my problem-solving skills through arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming. I believe a strong foundation in DSA is crucial for tackling real-world engineering challenges efficiently.

My strengths lie in my adaptability, problem-solving approach, and teamwork. I am always eager to learn and push my limits, aiming to build a career in SRE and DevOps. My goal is to contribute to building resilient, scalable, and high-performing systems.</p>
